🎙️ Welcome to the Dark Side of DIY Wireless – But Watch Your Step

You're standing at the edge of an incredibly powerful world — where garage door clicks, gas signs blink, and remotes dance in the Sub-GHz ether. Armed with your Flipper Zero and a fat little microSD card, you've got access to repositories that hold potential, possibility, and yes... danger.

🧠 But here's the truth most won't tell you:

Just because you can clone a signal…
Doesn't mean you should.
And if you don't understand what you're loading from GitHub?
You’re not a hacker — you’re a hazard.

🚧 USE THESE REPOS WISELY:

🔹 Jamming files:
👉 https://github.com/SHUR1K-N/Flipper-Zero-Sub-GHz-Jamming-Files
🚨 Illegal in many regions. Could interfere with emergency signals or legitimate devices. Use in a test lab, not in traffic.

🔹 Gas sign remotes:
👉 https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Sub-GHz/Gas_Sign
💡 Awesome for learning signal patterns — not for playing pranks on gas stations.

🔹 Sub-GHz Everything:
👉 https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper
🌐 A library of signals from garage doors to car keys. Respect what you're learning.

🔹 YouTube How-To’s (Use Responsibly):

💾 And don't forget your gear matters too:

✅ Use a trusted SD card:

SanDisk Extreme 32GB

Samsung EVO Select
⚠️ Avoid 64GB+ unless you know how to properly format FAT32.

Because if your SD card corrupts? You’ll lose payloads.
If your Flipper glitches mid-jam? You might crash more than just a demo.

🎤 Final Words, Rookie Hacker:

Hacking isn’t about pressing send — it’s about knowing what happens after.
These tools aren’t toys. They’re like lockpicks — cool to own, but illegal to use on someone else’s front door.

So:

🔐 Hack responsibly
📚 Learn deeply
🔥 Don’t burn bridges — or frequencies

And always remember…

This is your power.
Use it. Don’t abuse it.
